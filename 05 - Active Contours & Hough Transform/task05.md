# Computer Vision Techniques for Image Analysis

This document outlines a series of exercises designed to familiarize users with advanced image analysis techniques using built-in functions from widely used libraries. These exercises encompass active contour segmentation, Hough transform for line and circle detection, and practical applications in processing and analyzing images.

## Exercise Overview

### Active Contour Segmentation
- **Objective**: Learn to apply active contour segmentation to extract object boundaries within images.
- **Task**:
  - **Documentation**: Review the function documentation and explore example usages.
  - **Implementation**: Apply the function on sample images to segment and extract boundaries.

### Hough Transform for Line Detection
- **Objective**: Utilize Hough transform functions to detect lines within images.
- **Task**:
  - **Documentation**: Study the function's documentation and try out the 'Find Line Segments and Highlight Longest Segment' example.
  - **Implementation**: Extract finite lines from sample images and visualize the detected line segments.

### Circle Detection Using Hough Transform
- **Objective**: Implement circle Hough transform to detect circular shapes in images, such as coins and domino pips.
- **Task**:
  - **Documentation**: Review the function documentation and explore provided examples.
  - **Implementation**: Detect circles in sample images, visualize the results, and output the counts of detected circles.

## General Instructions

1. **Preparation**:
   - Read through the documentation of each specified function carefully.
   - Understand the input parameters and return values.

2. **Execution**:
   - Load the provided images and, if necessary, preprocess them to enhance feature detectability.
   - Utilize interactive methods (e.g., `roipoly` for active contours) to select initial parameters or regions.
   - Apply the analysis functions with adjusted parameters to achieve optimal results.

3. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - For each exercise, create visualizations to compare initial selections with the analysis results.
   - Analyze the effectiveness of the techniques and adjust parameters as needed for better outcomes.

4. **Extension**:
   - If applicable, compare the results with those obtained from previous exercises or custom implementations to evaluate the performance and accuracy of built-in functions versus manual implementations.

# Key Takeaways

  - Learned the importance of parameter tuning for contour fitting.
  - Gained proficiency with several OpenCV and Skimage methods for line detection.
  - Learned that to avoid memory shortage one option is to reduce the images.
  - Built competency in comparing library-based solutions with manual implementations.
