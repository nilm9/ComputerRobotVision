# Hough Transform for Line Detection


## Exercise 13: Hough Transform for Straight Lines

### Implementation
- Develop `MyHough.m`, a function to calculate the Hough transform of a binary edge image.
- Compute the accumulator array for the transform, with distance values ranging from `-D` to `D` (where `D` is the rounded-up diagonal length of the image) and angle values in degrees from `-90` to `89`.

### Testing
- Validate the function using a provided test scenario (`MyHoughTesting.m`) involving a simple edge image with two horizontal lines.
- Visualize the edge image and the Hough transform image, both in normal and logarithmic scale, to verify the correctness of the implementation.

## Exercise 14: Applying and Testing MyHough

### Steps
- Load the test edge image `edge01.png`, convert it to a binary format.
- Execute the Hough transform with `MyHough`.
- Display the edge and Hough images.
- Identify the highest peak in the Hough image and draw the corresponding line in the edge image.
- Adapt the script to find and draw the `N` highest peaks representing the lines.

### Goal
- Fine-tune the parameter `N` to detect all sides of a rectangle in the image with minimal value.


## Key Takeaways

### Steps of the Hough Transform Algorithm

1. **Subdivision of Feature Domain**:
   - The feature domain is divided into cells (bins), also known as rasterization.
   - Each bin represents a set of value combinations of the feature domain.

2. **Accumulator Definition**:
   - An accumulator is defined for each bin.
   - The entry for each bin is initialized to zero.

3. **Edge Point Analysis**:
   - For each gray-level edge point of the image, identify all possible value combinations in the feature domain that satisfy the equation of the analytic form.
   - For each accumulator that contains at least one value combination from this set, increase its count by one.

4. **Maximum Value Identification**:
   - Locate the bin with the maximum entry in the accumulator array.
   - This process is synonymous with finding the maximum value in the so-called Hough image.


### Additional notes

- **Robustness Against Noise and Gaps**: It's highly effective in line detection due to its tolerance towards image noise and feature discontinuities.

- **Parameter Space and Voting Mechanism**: Utilizes a parameter space to which image points are mapped and intersections in this space are indicative of shape presence.

- **Accumulator Array**: Accumulates evidence of line presence in a discretized parameter space through a voting mechanism.

- **Edge Detection Prerequisite**: Requires an initial edge detection step and is influenced by its quality.

- **Algorithm Complexity**: Computationally intensive but can be optimized for better performance.

- **Peak Identification**: Peaks in the accumulator array correspond to the most prominent lines in the image space.
