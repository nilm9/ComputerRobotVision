# Optical Flow Estimation Exercises

## Overview
This set of exercises aims to implement the optical flow algorithm using Python. The exercises progress through visualizing vector fields, creating an optical flow function, visualizing the optical flow, and applying it to image sequences.

## 22. Visualizing a Vector Field
Learn the basics of visualizing a vector field by defining simple vectors on a set of points and displaying them. This prepares us for visualizing optical flow in more complex images.

## 23. Optical Flow Function (`MyOpticalFlow`)
Develop a function that calculates the optical flow given two grayscale images and the side length of the local area for analysis. Implement gradient estimation using the Prewitt operator for spatial gradients and simple subtraction for temporal gradients.

## 24. Optical Flow Visualization (`MyOpticalFlowVisualization`)
Create a function to visualize the computed optical flow on top of an image and save the visualization. The function should allow for scaling the flow vectors for better visibility.

## 25. Applying Optical Flow
Write a script to apply the `MyOpticalFlow` and `MyOpticalFlowVisualization` functions to three image sequences. Process each image by loading, converting to grayscale, scaling, and then applying the optical flow functions. Experiment with different sizes for the local analysis area to see the effects on the flow visualization.

## Instructions for Running the Python Scripts
1. Ensure all required Python libraries are installed (e.g., OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib).
2. Organize the scripts into a directory, including the `MyOpticalFlow.py` and `MyOpticalFlowVisualization.py` modules.
3. Execute the main script to process the image sequences and visualize the optical flow.

# Key Takeaways

- Gradient computation, specifically using operators like Prewitt for spatial gradients, is crucial for estimating the motion between images.
- Breaking down an image into local analysis areas allows for a more detailed and localized flow computation, offering insights into various motion patterns across the image.
- The Lucas-Kanade method, used here, emphasizes the importance of solving a system of equations derived from gradient information to deduce motion vectors.
- Processing sequences of images with optical flow algorithms demonstrates the method's utility in tracking movements and changes in dynamic environments.
- Experimentation with parameters such as the size of the local analysis area can significantly impact the visualization and interpretation of flow vectors, emphasizing the importance of context and objectives in optical flow analysis.
